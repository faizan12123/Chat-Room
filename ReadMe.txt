Contributions:
Faizan Hussain and Edgar Chavez collaborated equally on this project. They approached the project with a peer-programming method since the knowlege needed to complete this project
was new to both Edgar and Faizan. They decided it would be more effecient if they worked together to build each functionality of the program one-by-one. This resulted in an equal effort/
contribution by both peers.

Prerequisites:
User must install python version 3.10.0 on their computer from https://www.python.org/downloads/ in order to run the files.


Running The Application:
User must launch a terminal and must enter the command, "python chat.py <port#>". Using the command "python" to run a python file could differ depending on how system variables have been intialized.
